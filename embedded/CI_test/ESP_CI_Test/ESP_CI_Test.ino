 * @warning This sketch is based on a wiring diagram, and was not yet tested on hardware. (Remove this line once tested on hardware and in system.)
 * @brief ESP CI test compile
 *
 * @details This is the OpenHornet Sketch Template. It should be used as a starting point for every new sketch.
 * Please copy the whole OHSketchTemplate folder to start, and ensure the correct line in the Makefile is uncommented.

 *  * **Reference Designator:** <Replace with full reference designator.>
 *  * **Intended Board:** <Replace with the appropriate hardware, i.e. ABSIS ALE, ABSIS ALE w/ Relay Module, etc.>

 * 
 * @brief The following #define tells DCS-BIOS that this is a RS-485 slave device.
 * It also sets the address of this slave device. The slave address should be
 * between 1 and 126 and must be unique among all devices on the same bus.
 *
 * @bug Currently does not work with the Pro Micro (32U4), Fails to compile. 

   #define DCSBIOS_RS485_SLAVE 1 ///DCSBios RS485 Bus Address, once bug resolved move line below comment.
